# 5500-Project

Our idea is to create a trip planner in which users can create an itinerary by searching through Airbnbs and restaurants across the country. Many travelers struggle to plan their trips effectively, often having to rely on multiple websites and sources to find accommodations and dining options. We aim to simplify this process by creating a comprehensive trip planner. The problem this application solves is the inconvenience of planning trips, especially when users with specific preferences want to find suitable Airbnb accommodations and nearby restaurants.
